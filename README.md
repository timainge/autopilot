Autopilot is the outer loop for Claude Code. You describe what needs building; autopilot plans it, judges it, and runs it — task by task, sprint by sprint — without you sitting there typing "continue".

It has two modes:

- **Task execution** — write a task manifest, autopilot runs it. Good for well-defined work.
- **Roadmap-driven sprints** — describe a goal, autopilot figures out the tasks, runs sprints, and checks whether the goal has been met. Good for open-ended projects.

## Install

```bash
pip install claude-autopilot
# or
uv pip install claude-autopilot
```

You need a Claude API key or a Claude Code subscription token:

```bash
# Option 1: API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Option 2: Claude Code subscription (Max/Pro)
claude setup-token
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<token from above>
```

## Task Execution

The basic flow: roadmap → plan → sprint. Or use `build` to combine plan + sprint in one shot.

### Roadmap (optional but recommended)

```bash
autopilot roadmap .              # quick assessment → .dev/roadmap.md
autopilot roadmap --deep .       # deep research first, then roadmap
autopilot roadmap --topic "How should I structure the auth layer?" .
autopilot roadmap --topic-file research-brief.md .
```

The roadmap agent determines the right goal (production launch, library publish, blog post, etc.) with concrete phases and effort estimates. Pass `--deep` to run a thorough research pass (web search + ecosystem scan) before building the roadmap. Pass `--topic` or `--topic-file` to research a specific question — this writes a report to `.dev/research/{slug}/report.md` without producing a roadmap. The roadmap step is not required, but the planner produces much better tasks with this context.

### Plan

```bash
# Lazy: auto-runs roadmap first if it doesn't exist
autopilot plan .

# Seed with a TODO list, spec, or design doc — skips lazy research
autopilot plan --context TODO.md .
```

The planner writes `.dev/sprint.md` — a markdown file with YAML frontmatter and checkbox tasks. A critic agent automatically reviews the plan (if its config exists), then a judge evaluates readiness. If the judge says NOT_READY, the planner revises once with the judge's feedback and the judge re-evaluates. When the judge approves, `approved: true` is set in the manifest automatically.

### Sprint

```bash
autopilot sprint .

# Bypass the approval check
autopilot sprint --auto-approve .

# Reset stuck projects and retry failed tasks
autopilot sprint --resume .
```

Executes the approved `.dev/sprint.md` task manifest. Autopilot loops through tasks sequentially. Each task spawns a fresh Claude Code session that implements the work, commits, and marks the checkbox done. Failed tasks are retried up to `max_task_attempts` times.

If `approved: false` in the manifest, sprint refuses to execute unless `--auto-approve` is passed.

### Build (one-shot)

```bash
# Plan then execute in one command
autopilot build .

# With context file for the planner
autopilot build --context spec.md .
```

Equivalent to running `autopilot plan .` followed by `autopilot sprint --auto-approve .`.

## Roadmap-Driven Development (Ralph)

For open-ended goals — "get this library to a publishable state", "make this API production-ready" — the `ralph` command is the fully autonomous outer loop. You describe the goal, autopilot figures out the tasks, runs sprints, and checks whether the goal has been met.

### Roadmap

```bash
autopilot roadmap .
autopilot roadmap --deep .    # deep research first
```

The roadmap agent writes `.dev/roadmap.md` with:
- YAML frontmatter: **goal type** (`launch`, `publish`, or `complete`), **archetype**, and `validate` commands
- A shipping roadmap body: target, phases, steps, success criteria

This file is both ralph's input and its termination condition. The `validate` commands are shell commands that must pass for the goal to be met.

### Ralph (outer loop)

```bash
# Run until goal met, stuck, or max_sprints reached
autopilot ralph .
```

Each iteration:
1. **Plan**: runs planner + critic + judge to produce an approved `.dev/sprint.md`
2. **Execute**: runs the worker loop on the sprint tasks
3. **Validate**: runs the `validate` commands from `roadmap.md` frontmatter
4. **Evaluate**: asks the roadmap agent whether the goal has been met

Ralph loops until one of:
- Goal is met (evaluator returns `GOAL_MET`)
- Tasks fail in a sprint (appends a deferred investigation task to `roadmap.md` and stops)
- `max_sprints` is reached
- Plan is not approved after the judge loop

---

## Multi-Repo Workflow

Every command works with `--scan` to operate across an entire directory:

```bash
autopilot roadmap --scan ~/Projects
autopilot plan --scan ~/Projects
autopilot sprint --auto-approve --scan ~/Projects
```

`portfolio` is multi-project only — it builds a cross-project index with analysis by goal, tech stack, current state, and prioritized quick wins. It auto-generates `.dev/roadmap.md` for any project that lacks one before building the portfolio (using deep research if no existing research artifacts exist):

```bash
autopilot portfolio --scan ~/Projects
```

Output is written to `<scan_dir>/.dev/portfolio.md`. The portfolio agent reads each project's `roadmap.md` as its primary input.

### Fork filtering

When scanning, repos you don't own are skipped by default. Autopilot compares the git remote owner against your username. Configure via (checked in order):

```bash
export AUTOPILOT_GIT_USER=yourusername
# or
git config --global autopilot.user yourusername
# or have the gh CLI logged in (auto-detected)
```

Use `--all` to include forks and clones.

## Manifest Format

Two key manifest files:

- **`.dev/sprint.md`** — task manifest, written by `plan`, read by `sprint`. Contains tasks with checkboxes.
- **`.dev/roadmap.md`** — roadmap manifest, written by `roadmap`. Contains a goal, archetype, `validate` commands in YAML frontmatter, plus the shipping roadmap body.

Both use YAML frontmatter + markdown format. Add `.dev/` to `.gitignore` — it contains orchestration state, not source code.

### Frontmatter fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | dir name | Project display name |
| `approved` | bool | false | Human approval gate |
| `status` | string | pending | pending / active / stuck / completed |
| `worktree` | bool | false | Run each task in an isolated git worktree |
| `branch_prefix` | string | autopilot | Branch prefix when `worktree: true` |
| `max_budget_usd` | float | 5.0 | Budget cap per project run |
| `max_task_attempts` | int | 3 | Max retries per task before marking failed |
| `goal` | string | — | Goal type: launch / publish / complete (roadmap frontmatter) |
| `archetype` | string | — | Project archetype (e.g. `python-cli`) for bundled runbooks (roadmap frontmatter) |
| `validate` | list | — | Shell commands that must pass for goal completion (roadmap frontmatter) |

### Task format

Tasks are level-3 headings with a checkbox, a slug ID, optional inline metadata, and a body:

```markdown
### [ ] task-slug-id

Body text describing what the worker agent should do. Can be multiple paragraphs,
include file paths, acceptance criteria, implementation notes, etc.

---

### [ ] another-task [depends: task-slug-id]

Body text for this task.

---

### [x] completed-task
```

- **IDs** are the heading text — must be slug format (`lowercase-with-dashes`)
- **Dependencies** use `[depends: task-id-1, task-id-2]` inline in the heading
- **Retry metadata** (`[attempts: N]`, `[status: failed]`, `[error: ...]`) is written by autopilot and should not be edited manually

---

## Agent Roles

Agent configs live in `src/autopilot/agents/*.md` — YAML frontmatter + system prompt. Sessions appear in Claude Code's `/resume` history as `autopilot/projectname/role`.

| Role | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `judge` | (internal to `plan`) | Evaluates manifest readiness, prints READY / NOT_READY |
| `worker` | `sprint` | Executes a task: implements, tests, commits |
| `planner` | `plan` | Creates `.dev/sprint.md` with structured tasks |
| `critic` | (internal to `plan`) | Reviews plan adversarially, edits manifest directly |
| `researcher` | (internal) | Analyzes codebase → `.dev/project-summary.md` |
| `deep-researcher` | `roadmap --deep` | Extended analysis with web search |
| `roadmap` | `roadmap` / `ralph` | Shipping target + goal + validate → `.dev/roadmap.md` (create mode); evaluates goal completion (evaluate mode) |
| `portfolio` | `portfolio` | Cross-project index → `<scan_dir>/.dev/portfolio.md` |

### Custom roles

Add markdown files to `agents/` (use `--agents-dir` for a custom directory):

```markdown
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews completed tasks for quality
allowed_tools: [Read, Glob, Bash, Grep]
permission_mode: default
max_turns: 20
max_budget_usd: 0.50
---

You review recently completed tasks for quality...
```

## Design Notes

**Why the Agent SDK, not CLI pipes?**
The Agent SDK wraps the Claude Code CLI programmatically — same tools, proper message streaming, error handling, no heredoc escaping. Each `query()` call is a fresh Claude Code session.

**Why sequential, not parallel?**
Simpler to debug, cheaper, and avoids merge conflicts. Parallelism via git worktrees can be added later.

**Why a human approval gate?**
The judge evaluates readiness, but a human must explicitly set `approved: true` (or pass `--auto-approve`). This prevents runaway execution on half-baked plans.

**Why markdown manifests, not YAML/JSON?**
The manifest doubles as project documentation. YAML frontmatter gives structured config; the markdown body gives rich context that both humans and agents can read naturally.

**Why does the roadmap agent have two modes?**
In create mode, the roadmap agent produces `.dev/roadmap.md` — a shipping target, phases, and success criteria with `goal:` and `validate:` frontmatter. In evaluate mode (used by `sprint`), it reads that same roadmap plus the sprint log and assesses whether the goal has been met. One agent, one artifact, two perspectives.
